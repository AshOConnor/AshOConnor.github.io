      <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
      <h3>• What is my interest in IT? When did my interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked my interest?</h3>

      </p>
      <h3>• Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
      <p>I chose RMIT as it offered a pathways course with Open Universities Australia. As I did not finish year 12 or have a qualification other than a certificate III,
        this pathway allows me to complete two units, if successful in passing then I can continue with the Bachelor of Information Technology.
